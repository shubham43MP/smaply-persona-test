## Dev Comments

- Used index.ts in various files just to have a kind of modular formatting
- There are a few inline styles being used due to a tailwind config issue, those colors are not recognised so have used at a few places, and that
- yjs collaboration havent added due to time considerations
- Designs can be further inch tweaked and made closer incluing responsive.
- components are of two types - atoms and compounds. Atoms are single elements very small ones while compounds are complex components that can be fairly reused as well
